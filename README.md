# Project-2
Group Project incorporating a Node and Express web server; backed by MySQL using an ORM and deployed using Heroku

The enclosed repo includes a social networking application for Curb your Enthusiasm fans built by a team of (3) using a MVC paradigm and ORM with a Node and Express web server.  The application was initially backed by a local MySQL database then deployed via Heroku allowing users to access the same relational database using JawsDB.  Grunt.js was used as a task runner to ensure dynamic styling with Sass and included Travis CI for continuous integration.

My contribution to the project included incorporating the initial MySQL database, implementing the CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete) process for blog posts within the app, assisting with establishing the routes, incorporated the showâ€™s theme song and a countdown using JavaScript, and integrated the use of Grunt.js, Sass and Travis CI into the project.
