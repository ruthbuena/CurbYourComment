Testing Suggestions
* Set up Karma so you can run your tests as you develop.
* Prior to implementing a feature, use Nightmare to write a functional test for it.
* Prior to implementing a function, use Mocha and Chai to write unit tests against it.
* Run your tests prior to committing your code so you can be sure nothing breaks between commits.
* **Non-Obligatory Bonus**: Set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). This will automatically run your tests whenever you or any of your team members makes a commit.
